# Data analysis

## Investment trends in Africa and Asia

@fig-investment-trends presents a bar plot illustrating the number of WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) investment projects in Africa and Asia, aggregated over 10-year intervals from 1960 to 2010.

```{r}
#| label: fig-investment-trends
#| fig-cap: "Number of WASH investment projects in Africa and Asia, aggregated by decade (1960â€“2010)."

# Create bar plots of investment trends
ggplot(continent_counts, aes(x = year_interval, y = count, fill = continent)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +  # Position dodge for side-by-side bars
  labs(x = "Year interval",
       y = "Number of investment projects",
       fill = "Continent") +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", color = "#333333")) +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Investment trends in Asia by region

@fig-asia-regional-investments summarizes the number of WASH investment projects across different regions within Asia. Each bar represents a specific Asian region (such as Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Polynesia, South-eastern Asia, etc.), and the height of the bar indicates the total number of projects recorded in each region.

```{r}
#| label: fig-asia-regional-investments
#| fig-cap: "Number of WASH investment projects by region within Asia"

ggplot(washinvestments_asia, aes(x = year, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1960, 2020, 10)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Number of investment projects",
       fill = "Region") +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", color = "#333333")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Investment trends in Africa by region

@fig-africa-regional-investments presents a bar plot showing the number of WASH investment projects across various African regions. Each bar corresponds to a specific region (such as Northern Africa, Eastern Africa, Middle Africa, Western Africa, etc.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-africa-regional-investments
#| fig-cap: "Number of WASH investment projects by region within Africa, ordered from highest to lowest."

ggplot(washinvestments_africa, aes(x = year, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1960, 2020, 10)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Number of investment projects",
       fill = "Region") +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", color = "#333333")) +
  theme_minimal()
```
